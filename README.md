📍 Campus Navigation Assistant

A console-based navigation system for university campuses, built in Java.
This project demonstrates advanced object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts, routing algorithms, and interactive console visualization (colored mini-maps).

The project also aligns with SDG 9: Industry, Innovation & Infrastructure, by showcasing how technology can enhance navigation, accessibility, and digital infrastructure within educational institutions.

🚀 Features

🏢 Add and remove campus buildings dynamically

🔗 Connect and disconnect buildings with weighted distances

🛣️ Find the shortest route between two buildings using Dijkstra's Algorithm

🌈 Console mini-map visualization with ANSI colors

Green → Start building

Cyan → Intermediate path

Red → Destination

📋 Show all available buildings

🔎 Show all building connections (without duplicates)

✅ Comprehensive error handling
